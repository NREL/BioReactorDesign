## Quick start
1. Follow the steps to install the python package (see `Installation of python package for developers` or `Installation of python package for users` below)
2. Follow the steps to install the BiRD OpenFOAM solver (see `Installation of BiRD OpenFOAM solver (for developers and users)` below)
3. Check that you can run any of the tutorial cases, for ex:

```bash
cd tutorial_cases/bubble_column_20L
bash run.sh
``` 

## Installation of python package for developers

```bash
conda create --name bird python=3.10
conda activate bird
git clone https://github.com/NREL/BioReactorDesign.git
cd BioReactorDesign
pip install -e .
```

## Installation of python package for users

```bash
conda create --name bird python=3.10
conda activate bird
pip install nrel-bird
```

## Installation of BiRD OpenFOAM solver (for developers and users)

1. Activate your OpenFOAM-9 environment (`source <OpenFOAM-9 installation directory>/etc/<your-shell>rc`)
2. cd `OFsolvers/birdmultiphaseEulerFoam/`
3. `./Allwmake`
