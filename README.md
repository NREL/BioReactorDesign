conda create --name bird python=3.10
conda activate bird
git clone https://github.com/NREL/BioReactorDesign.git
cd BioReactorDesign
pip install -e .
```

## Installation for users

```bash
conda create --name bird python=3.10
conda activate bird
pip install nrel-bird

## OpenFOAM solvers

Place the attached models in `OFsolvers` into the same arborescence in your `$FOAM_APP` directory. These compile with `openFOAM-9`

We provide a new drag model `Grace`, a new interfacial composition model `Higbie` and various other models which magnitude can be controlled via an efficiency factor `*_limited`


## Meshing

### Generate Stir tank mesh

```bash
inp=bird/meshing/stir_tank_mesh_templates/base_tank/tank_par.yaml
out=bird/meshing/stir_tank_case_templates/base/system/blockMeshDict

python applications/write_stir_tank_mesh.py -i $inp -o $out
```

Generates a blockMeshDict

Then activate openFoam environment (tested with OpenFoam9) and mesh with

```bash
blockMesh -dict system/blockMeshDict
stitchMesh -perfect -overwrite inside_to_hub inside_to_hub_copy
stitchMesh -perfect -overwrite hub_to_rotor hub_to_rotor_copy
transformPoints "rotate=((0 0 1)(0 1 0))":
```

### Generate STL mesh

`python applications/write_stl_mesh.py -v -cr 0.25 -na 12 -aw 0.1 -al 0.5`

Generates

### Manual

```
usage: write_stl_mesh.py [-h] [-cr] [-na] [-aw] [-al] [-v]

Generate Spider Sparger STL

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -cr , --centerRadius
                        Radius of the center distributor
  -na , --nArms         Number of spider arms
  -aw , --armsWidth     Width of spider arms
  -al , --armsLength    Length of spider arms
  -v, --verbose         plot on screen

```

### Block cylindrical meshing

Generates `blockMeshDict` in `system`

```bash
root=`pwd`
caseFolder=bird/meshing/block_cyl_cases_templates/case
mesh_temp=bird/meshing/block_cyl_mesh_templates/sideSparger

python applications/write_block_cyl_mesh.py -i $mesh_temp/input.json -t $mesh_temp/topology.json -o $caseFolder/system
```

Then activate openFoam environment (tested with OpenFoam9) and mesh with

```bash
cd $caseFolder
blockMesh
transformPoints "scale=(0.001 0.001 0.001)"
transformPoints "rotate=((0 0 1) (0 1 0))"
cd $root
```

Will generate this

#### How to change the dimensions or mesh refinement

All dimensions and mesh are controlled by the input file `input.json`. 
The input file can also be in `.yaml` format. The parser will decide the file format based on its extension. 
See `bird/meshing/block_cyl_mesh_templates/baseColumn/` for an example of `.yaml`

#### How to change the arrangement of concentric cylinders

The block topology is controlled by the `topology.json`
Always work with a schematic. Here is the schematic for this case

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/schematic.png" width="250"/>
</p>

The purple blocks are walls (not meshed) and the white blocks are fluid blocks (meshed). The symmetry axis is indicated as a dashed line

In the `topology.json`, the purple blocks are defined as

```
"Walls": {
                "Support": [
                            {"R": 0, "L": 3},
                            {"R": 1, "L": 3}
                           ],
                "Sparger": [
                            {"R": 0, "L": 2},
                            {"R": 1, "L": 2},
                            {"R": 2, "L": 2}
                           ]
        }
```

#### How to change boundaries

Boundaries are defined with three types, `top`, `bottom` and `lateral`

In the case of sparger walls shown below with the red lines
<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/schematicSpargerWalls.png" width="250"/>
</p>

the boundary is defined in the `topology.json` as
```
"Boundary": {
                "wall_sparger":[
                           {"type": "bottom", "Rmin": 2, "Rmax": 2, "Lmin": 2, "Lmax": 3},
                           {"type": "top", "Rmin": 0, "Rmax": 0, "Lmin": 1, "Lmax": 2},
                           {"type": "top", "Rmin": 1, "Rmax": 1, "Lmin": 1, "Lmax": 2},
                           {"type": "top", "Rmin": 2, "Rmax": 2, "Lmin": 1, "Lmax": 2}
                         ],
...
```

In the case of sparger inlet shown below with the red line
<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/schematicSpargerInlet.png" width="250"/>
</p>

the boundary is defined in the `topology.json` as
```
"Boundary": {
                "inlet": [
                           {"type": "lateral", "Rmin": 2, "Rmax": 3, "Lmin": 2, "Lmax": 2}
                         ],
...
```
